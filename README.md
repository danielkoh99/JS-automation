# JS-automation
This is a script that was used to help a back-office workers job to find which jobs on this particular website had home-office options. If it doesn't find the exact words I inputted, then in the console it will write "no home office", but if it finds one, it will get the url of the job/jobs and copy it in a text file. This was written with Node.js and Puppeteer.js.
